# Historical Formosa
## a Victoria 3 mod
[中文](README_zh-TW.md)

A revised framework of Formosa's population, culture, etc. in the 19th century. After all, it is too difficult for Paradox to do their history homework.
Since some East Asia related files have been changed/overwritten, its compatibility is bad.

[list][h3]Country[/h3]
[*] A new country, Lonc-kjauw, as a decentralized power representing the aboriginal realms.

[h3]Resources[/h3]
[*]Coal, sulfur, gold mines, malaria. As for the coffee, it will not be added after consideration.

[h3]Culture[/h3]
[*]Delete YUZ(yuanzhumin)
[*]Add FRS(formosan) instead. Although both are names for the island from outsiders, but "formosan" is academic conventions.
FRS uses the southern formosan Austronesian branch, including Seqalu group, Paiwan group and Bunun group, as model ethnic species to fill the list of names.
After all, if we want to follow to the classification standards of other Austronesian cultures in the game, more than 8 cultures will have to be made on the island of Formosa alone.
[*] Place(hub) names are based on 19th-century Western map, which is transcribed with local pronunciation then.
台北(city) "Taipak", 打狗(port) "Takau", 八斗子(mine) "Patauw", 彰化(farm) "Chianghoa", 嘉義(wood) "Kagi"

[h3]Population[/h3]
[*] Qing Formosa: Based on the population estimate of 1811 and it was divided into Hokkien, Hakka and Cantonese(Teochew) people according to the proportion of Japanese statistics in the early 20th century. 
Not exact but better than a wild guess.
Replace the Manchu population in Taiwan with Han people (Chinese other than Hokkien, Hakka and Cantonese people).
[*]Lonc-kjauw: Based on the population estimate of 1893, it is extremely inaccurate. But it’s better than the crazy 600,000 yuanzhumin in the vanilla.
The historical monarch of Lonc-kjauw in 1836 was the father of Tokitok, Paljaljaus Garuljigulj.
